    "# 51. Why is encapsulation considered a pillar of object-oriented programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation is considered one of the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it promotes several key principles that are fundamental to the design and development of robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Here are some reasons why encapsulation is regarded as crucial in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.Data Hiding: Encapsulation allows the internal state of an object (its data) to be hidden from the outside world. By controlling access to the object's attributes and methods, encapsulation prevents direct manipulation of the object's state, reducing the risk of accidental modification or misuse. This enhances data integrity and security within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Abstraction: Encapsulation enables the concept of abstraction, where the complex implementation details of an object are hidden behind a simple and intuitive interface. Users of the object interact with it through well-defined methods and properties, without needing to understand how those methods are implemented internally. This abstraction simplifies the usage of objects and promotes code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Modularity and Reusability: Encapsulation facilitates modularity by encapsulating related data and behavior into a single unit (an object). Objects can be designed to operate independently, allowing developers to break down complex systems into smaller, manageable components. These components can then be reused in different parts of the application or in other applications altogether, leading to more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.Encapsulation of Invariants: Encapsulation allows developers to enforce invariants (constraints or rules) on the object's state by controlling access to its attributes and methods. By encapsulating the implementation details within the object, developers can ensure that the object's state remains consistent and valid at all times, even as the object is manipulated by various parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.Encapsulation of Implementation Changes: Encapsulation provides a clear boundary between an object's interface (public API) and its implementation details. This separation allows developers to modify or improve the internal implementation of an object without affecting the external code that interacts with it. As long as the object's interface remains unchanged, clients of the object can continue to use it without needing to update their code."

    "The @property decorator is a built-in Python decorator that allows you to define properties on a class. Properties are a special type of attribute that can have a getter, a setter, and a deleter. The getter and setter methods are used to get and set the value of the property, respectively. The deleter method is used to delete the property.\n",
    "One of the main benefits of using properties is that they allow you to control how your attributes are accessed and modified. For example, you can use a getter to validate the value of an attribute before it is set. You can also use a setter to perform some other action when an attribute is set, such as logging the change."

    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves wrapping data and methods together within a single unit, known as a class. This bundling of data and methods helps protect the data from being accessed or modified directly, promoting data security and integrity.\n",
    "Property decorators in Python play a crucial role in implementing encapsulation. They allow developers to define getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying class attributes, providing a controlled interface for data manipulation.\n"
